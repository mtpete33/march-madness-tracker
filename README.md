# 🏀 March Madness Family Draft Tracker

This web app tracks a custom family-style March Madness draft, where each participant selects 8 teams instead of filling out a traditional bracket. Points are awarded based on how far a team progresses in the NCAA tournament, with real-time scoring and live game updates.

It's over now, but you can still see all the past year's tournament game data as well as our family's scores, tourney winner, etc.
